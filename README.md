# WaterFlow_Path

## Overview
The Waterflow_Generator project is designed to simulate the natural flow of water on a given terrain represented by an STL file. By analyzing the topography of the terrain, the algorithm determines the path of water flow, starting from the highest point and following the steepest descent.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhicctech1003/WaterFlow_Path.git
    ```

2. **Build the Project:**

    Open the project in your preferred C++ IDE or build using the command line.

3. **Run the Application:**

    Execute the built binary to run the application.

## Approach
1. **Peak Identification**:
   - The program scans the terrain data to identify the highest elevation point along the Z-axis, which serves as the starting point for water flow simulation.

2. **Path Finding Algorithm**:
   - Starting from the highest point, the algorithm traverses the terrain by iteratively identifying adjacent points with the steepest descent.
   - It calculates the slope between neighboring points to determine the direction of water flow, ensuring a realistic simulation.
   - The path of water flow is traced until a point is reached where the elevation decreases, indicating the end of the path.

3. **Utilized Data Structures**:
   - **Point3d**: Represents a three-dimensional point in space.
   - **TriangulationTriangle**: Defines a triangle formed by three points, facilitating terrain analysis.
   - Additional utility classes such as **MathUtility** aid in slope calculation and path navigation.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Input**:
   - Provide the STL file containing the terrain data.
2. **Execution**:
   - Run the main program to initiate the water flow simulation algorithm.
3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the path of water flow, presented as a series of points or coordinates.

## Dependencies
- The Waterflow_Generator project requires a compatible C++ development environment.
- Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed and configured properly for seamless execution.
